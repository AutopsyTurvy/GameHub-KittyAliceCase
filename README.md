# Game Hub, Cross Course Project- 

This was our first project in the first year of our Studies-
This was initially our introduction into design and CSS, then an exercise in stretching our JavaScript skills.
The main purpose of this site was to advertise and sell games at competitive prices, to be able to view them and their specific details and to add them to your cart.


## Site purpose:

A game purchasing site with competitive prices and smooth functionality. An exercise in our design and JavaScript skills.



### Description

-- Home Page

Our home page was meant to introduce the site adequately, so at a glance it was obvious what the site did- 
Thous would be via a title or to introduce the games- i tried to do both.
This page should be easily to navigate through, and show clear options to view ore details about the games being sold. 

-- Games 

The user should have the option to click on one of the games displayed either on the home page, or a page where a selection of the games can be viewed, and be taken to a page the displays more information- 

-- Info page

The page where the user can see more of the pertinent details about their prospective purchase, the price, if said game is on sale, how many players, the genre and a descriptive paragraph about the gameplay and adventure ahead.

-- buy now

Upon clicking the "Buy Now"/ "Add to cart" button on either the home page or the product details page, the number next to the cart icon should increase. 
Whwn clicking on the cart icon itself, there should be visible a list of the games (or an empty cart if you have not selected any of the games), their prices, a running total and a "complete purchase" button that accurately simulates the buying process.


-- Contact Page

This page should have form validation, and simulate the process of emailing the hosts of the site.

-- Other Pages

For the functionality of the site the other pages are not integral- should inclide an "About us" page.


** Note **

No Tech used so far- Pure CSS, HTML, and JavaScript- will update if this changes
